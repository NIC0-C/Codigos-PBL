# Digital Safe — Finite State Machine (Verilog)

Academic project developed as part of a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) activity in Digital Circuits.

## Description
This project implements a **digital safe system** using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** described in **Verilog**.  
The main objective was to apply digital logic concepts to control access through a predefined sequence of inputs, simulating the behavior of a secure electronic lock.

The system transitions between states according to user inputs. Only when the correct input sequence is provided does the system reach the **unlocked state**, representing successful authentication. Incorrect sequences lead the system back to previous or locked states, ensuring controlled access.

## Objectives
- Apply Finite State Machine (FSM) concepts in a practical scenario  
- Design and implement state transitions using Verilog  
- Simulate a digital security system based on input sequences  
- Reinforce digital logic and hardware description principles  

## Project Characteristics
- FSM-based control logic  
- Sequential digital circuit design  
- Input-driven state transitions  
- Clear separation between states and outputs  

## Technologies Used
- **Verilog**
- **Digital Logic**
- **Finite State Machines (FSM)**

## Files
Due to file size limitations, the complete project files are provided in a compressed format:

## Notes
This is an **academic project**, developed for learning purposes. The code structure reflects educational objectives and focuses on clarity and correctness rather than production-level optimization.
